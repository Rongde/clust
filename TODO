TODO

- Implement co-association matrix, consensus matrix.

- Add a few basic ensemble clustering methods (kmeans on lines, Hierarchical clustering : see the litt. survey for this). If possible include some visual animation for this. Implement kmeans++ on rows.

- Add a few data sets

- Add some measures of diversity inside a partition set

- Implement some evaluation function on the consensus obtained 

- Make a R script that does all the workflow : data set, generate partitions, visualize them, compute consensus, measure its quality.

- Add possibilities for generation partition from a real data set : of generating random partitions with kmeans using a random number of cluster (drawn for each partition) ; using random projections, using random subsets.
